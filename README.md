# Paul Bréon - Computer Engineering Student and VR Enthusiast 🚀🎮🎵

## Introduction

Hello there! 👋 I'm Paul Bréon, a passionate computer engineering student at CESI Rouen. Currently, I am diving deep into the fascinating realms of virtual and augmented reality as part of my apprenticeship at CESI LINEACT research laboratory. Through this journey, I have honed my skills in various areas of computer science, including development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and networking.

When I'm not immersed in the world of computer science, you'll find me captivated by another passion of mine - music 🎵. I'm actively involved with the Société Musicale de Criquetot l'Esneval, where I'm both a skilled drummer and a conductor for the youth orchestra. Music holds a very special place in my heart, and it adds a unique rhythm to my life.

## Projects

### 3, 2, 1 Dimensions! 🎮

Behold my largest and most ambitious project on GitHub! "3, 2, 1 Dimensions!" is a puzzle game that challenges players to perceive dimensions in a mind-bending manner. As the creator, I've poured my heart and soul into every aspect of the game, from music composition to asset creation, scripting, and more. The ultimate goal is to publish this game, sharing its immersive experience with everyone, possibly on platforms like Steam.

### VR Ping Pong 🏓

To grasp the magic of virtual reality, I embarked on a journey to create a small introductory game. "VR Ping Pong" brings the classic game into the virtual world, allowing players to feel the excitement firsthand. I'm excited about the potential to add multiplayer functionality, which is the next step in enhancing the experience.

### My Personal Website 🌐

Seeking to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I took on the challenge of creating my very own website. This platform not only showcases my profile, skills, and projects but also gives me an opportunity to share my passion for music.

### CESI Projects 👨‍💻

As a CESI student, collaboration with team members on GitHub is second nature. You can explore the [Web-Project](https://github.com/PoloBrn/WebProject) from my second year at CESI, which I worked on alongside Léo and Damien. Additionally, you'll find interesting projects by my talented teammates, such as the [POO-Project](https://github.com/eraflo/POO_Project) and the [Embedded-Systems](https://github.com/timo-thi/Projet_embarque).

# Paul Bréon

## Presentation
I am Paul Bréon, a computer engineering student at CESI Rouen. Currently, I am pursuing my studies through an apprenticeship at CESI LINEACT research laboratory, where I am specializing in the exciting fields of virtual and augmented reality. This experience has allowed me to develop numerous skills in computer science, particularly in development, object-oriented programming (OOP), and networking.
Apart from my passion for computer science, I am an avid musician actively involved with the Société Musicale de Criquetot l'Esneval. As a drummer and conductor for the youth orchestra, music holds a very special place in my life.

## Projets
### 3, 2, 1 Dimensions !
This project is the biggest in my GitHub because it has the most complexe objective and is to create a puzzle game based on the perseption of the dimensions and create everything in it ! That include the musics the renderer the Assets write all the scripts the font, ..., **everything** !
The main objective is to publish the game (on Steam for example) when it will be finish to share it to everyone.

### VR Ping Pong
To learn how does the virtual reality works in Unity and in general, I wanted to create a little game as an introduction to the virtual reality to me. The objective is to create a Ping-Pong in virtual reality. A possible amelioration could be to add multiplayers in it and I think that would be the next step.

### My Web Site
To improve my competences in HTML, CSS and JavaScript I wanted to create my own web-site. This web-site is also an opportunity to share my profil, competences and projects and also share my hobbies like the music.
